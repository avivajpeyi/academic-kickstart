I am a PhD student at Monash University where I am researching gravitational waves as a member of the LIGO collaboration. My research focuses on utilising Bayesian inference to the study gravitational waves from merging black holes. More specifically, my research is on gravitational waves from intermediate-mass black holes -- an elusive class of black holes that astrophysicist have yet to detect!
